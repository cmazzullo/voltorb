=======

**Voltorb** is a platform on which to build turn-based games on
  Android. Or maybe it's a Pokemon clone.

  Update: Right now we really need a UserInterface interface!
  
  Get rattata from jepriebe for the user interface (in progress).
  
  TODO: FakeLobbies and UserThreads do not handle player disconnection yet.
	If one player disconnects, (for now) lobby should be destroyed and connected
	player set up with a new lobby for the next connected player to join.
	
	Game does not end when all monsters faint
