voltorb
=======

**Voltorb** is a platform on which to build turn-based games on
  Android. Or maybe it's a Pokemon clone.

To change: Get rid of ItemType enums and just use subclasses of Item instead. 
	Not sure why I didn't do this from the start.
  
  Update: Right now we really need a UserInterface interface!
