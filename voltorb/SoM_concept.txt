**Alternative idea:
States do not work like elements, providing bonuses and weaknesses to other states.
States are modifiers that monsters can acquire by transforming into a particular 
state, perhaps once they've filled a meter to initiate a transformation. When a 
monster possesses a particular state template, their strengths and weaknesses
relative to other elements do not change. HOWEVER, what changing states does do
is alter their stats in some fashion, in addition to modifying their attacks, or
even giving them new ones entirely. 

Example 1: An Air-type alters itself to the Gas state. Its agility, intellectual 
strength, and physical endurance go up, while its vitality and spiritual strength
go down. Attacks remain the same, damage increases because of type reinforcement.

Example 2: A light-type alters itself to the Liquid state. Its vitality, physical 
strength, and physical endurance go up, while its agility and intellectual strength
go down. Some of its attacks change, focusing more around illusions and attacks that
cause disorientation-style status effects, maybe creating a chance for an opponent
to hurt themselves.

Example 3: An Earth-type alters itself to the Liquid state. Same stat changes as in
Example 2. It's attacks do less damage, but they cause effects like reducing enemies'
agility and physical endurance.

Plasma works differently. It's frickin' plasma, so it's the most destructive state.
It requires a fuller meter to change into it. It provides a stronger suite of attacks
dependent on element, and strengths all go up. However, it can only be maintained 
for a limited amount of time, they can't be switched out, they can't use items (are 
there going to be items?) and they take some damage each turn they are in the state.
They're sort of a glass cannon, best reserved for when you think you can take your
opponent down quickly.

stats:

Vitality: health
Physical Strength: physical attack
Spiritual Strength: spirit attack
Intellecual Strength: intellect attack
Agility: speed
Physical Endurance: physical defense
Spiritual Endurance: spirit defense
Intellectual Endurance: intellect defense

Physical Strength ===> Spiritual Endurance
Spritual Strength ===> Intellectual Endurance
Intellectual Strength ===> Physical Endurance

**Just make them correspond normally to avoid confusion. KISS. -Jim**

damage = health - ((strength-endurance)*element*state*)
.05% chance of critical hit which will double damage

**Alternative for damage:
Make damage a range, to add a small element of chance. A set of equations calculates
the min and max values of a damage range instead of a single value. As strength 
increase, the min and max values increase together, and SLOWLY diverge from each other
(maybe to a maximum range limit).This is modified by the attacking power of the 
specific attack being used. (This is done here in case we want to make attacks that 
alter the base range.) A random value is picked from this range and put into the above
equation.

Taking into account the alternative model for States, the final equation is:
damage = health - ((calculated damage - endurance) * element)

***Actually, should probably incorporate endurance as a ratio with strength to avoid 
having to deal with negative damages.***

Status effect duration should be determined by a percentage chance to throw it off each 
round. This chance increases every round, linearly, until it reaches 100%. It always 
starts at 0% for the first turn.

**When applying status effects, the rate of increase of a monster's chance to throw off a
status effect depends on some equation that uses the relative values of the appropriate 
Strength of the attacker and Endurance of the attacked. So with poison, for instance, 
Physical Strength is compared to Physical Endurance to determine how quickly the attacked
monster's chance to throw off the effect increases.
